# Iris-Flower-Classification-
A machine learning project to classify Iris flower species using Python and Scikit-learn

This project demonstrates the end-to-end Machine Learning workflow on the classic Iris dataset, where the goal is to classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on sepal and petal measurements.

The project uses separate training and testing datasets (data-train.xlsx and data-test.xlsx) to ensure proper model validation and real-world testing.

# Objectives
* Understand the ML classification pipeline (data loading → training → testing → evaluation).
* Explore and preprocess tabular data using Pandas.
* Train a Decision Tree Classifier using Scikit-learn.
* Evaluate model accuracy and visualize performance metrics.
